        🕷️ Black Widow – The Deadliest Spy in the World
    </h3>
    <h4>
        Biography 
    </h4>
    <p>
        Born in the Soviet Union, Natasha Romanoff was recruited as a child into the infamous Red Room, a secret Soviet brainwashing and assassin-training program. There, she was trained in espionage, martial arts, weapons, infiltration, and psychological manipulation—becoming one of the deadliest operatives in the world.

Originally introduced as a Russian spy and antagonist to Iron Man, she eventually defected to the United States and joined S.H.I.E.L.D., where she became one of Nick Fury’s top agents. Over time, she earned redemption and became a key member of the Avengers, proving her loyalty, courage, and unmatched skills time and again.

Despite having no superhuman powers, Natasha is often the sharpest mind and most dangerous combatant in any room she enters.
