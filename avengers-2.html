        Biography 
    </h4>


    <p>
        Tony Stark is a billionaire industrialist, genius inventor, and founding member of the Avengers. After suffering a life-threatening injury and being captured by terrorists, he built the first Iron Man suit to escape captivity. This moment transformed him from a self-centered weapons manufacturer into a heroic defender of humanity.

        Using his unmatched intellect and cutting-edge technology, Tony continually upgrades his Iron Man armor, making it one of the most versatile and powerful tools in the Marvel Universe. He has faced enemies ranging from terrorists to aliens and gods, and even his own inner demons.
        
        Tony Stark is both admired and feared for his mind and inventions, and despite his flaws, he always strives to do whatâ€™s rightâ€”even if it costs him everything.
