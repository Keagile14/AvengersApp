        Biography 
    </h4>


    <p>
        Dr. Bruce Banner was a brilliant scientist working on gamma radiation experiments for the U.S. military. During a bomb test, he risked his life to save a young man and was exposed to lethal doses of gamma rays. This triggered a radical transformationâ€”when angry or emotionally stressed, Banner transforms into The Hulk, a near-unstoppable behemoth driven by rage.

        Over the years, Hulk has evolved through many personalities: from savage brute to cunning gladiator to merged intellects like Professor Hulk. His power is directly tied to his emotional stateâ€”the angrier he gets, the stronger and more invulnerable he becomes.
        
        Though often seen as a destructive force, Hulk has fought alongside the Avengers and saved the world countless times. His struggle between man and monster makes him one of Marvelâ€™s most tragic and compelling heroes.
