        Biography 
    </h4>


    <p>
Thor is the Norse God of Thunder and a founding member of the Avengers. Born in Asgard as the son of Odin Allfather and the elder goddess Gaea, Thor was raised to be a mighty warrior and future king. Wielding the enchanted hammer Mjolnir, he commands the power of storms and lightning, and is nearly unmatched in strength and endurance.

Originally arrogant and headstrong, Thor's time spent on Earth humbled him, forging him into a selfless protector of both Asgard and Midgard (Earth). He balances divine power with mortal compassion, becoming a bridge between realms.

Thor has faced cosmic threats like Loki, Hela, Thanos, and even Gorr the God Butcher, proving time and again why he is one of the most powerful beings in the Marvel Universe.    </p>
