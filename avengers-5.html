        Biography 
    </h4>
    <p>
        Steve Rogers was a frail young man during World War II who desperately wanted to serve his country. Chosen for the top-secret Super Soldier Program, he was injected with the Super Soldier Serum, transforming him into the peak of human potential‚Äîstronger, faster, and more durable than any ordinary human.

Wielding an indestructible vibranium shield, Captain America became a symbol of hope and justice, fighting Hydra and the Red Skull during WWII. After being frozen in ice for decades, he was revived in the modern age and went on to become the moral compass and field leader of the Avengers.

A tactician, fighter, and symbol of resilience, Cap stands not because of raw power, but because of his unyielding will, leadership, and honor.
