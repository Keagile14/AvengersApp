        Biography 
    </h4>


    <p>
        Clint Barton, orphaned at a young age, ran away from home and joined a traveling circus where he trained under the swordsman and trick-shot artists. He honed his skills to perfection and became a master archer and acrobat. Inspired by Iron Man, Clint attempted to become a hero but was mistaken for a criminal at first.

Eventually, he earned a place among the Avengers, where his bravery, loyalty, and skill with a bow made him a valued memberâ€”even among gods, super-soldiers, and billionaires.

Though he has no superpowers, Hawkeye consistently proves that a determined human with exceptional skill and grit can stand toe-to-toe with the most powerful beings in the Marvel Universe.
